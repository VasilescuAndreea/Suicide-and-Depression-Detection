# Detecting Depression and Suicide in Reddit

## Abstract

This project focuses on the crucial task of detecting depression and suicide-related content in Reddit posts. With the increasing impact of depression on individuals' quality of life, leveraging natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning becomes essential in identifying potential cases of mental health concerns. We utilized selected posts from Kaggle's r/SuicideWatch and r/depression subreddits, applying various models to determine the most effective approach for suicide and depression detection.
